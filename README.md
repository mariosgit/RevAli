Reverse engineered and reviewed tech stuff from a big far east sales thing.

| ADAU1452 + AD1938 board bundle <br><br> One of the more excessive investments you can do on AliEx. For around 75-110 bugs <br> you get a nice DSP and CODEC to play with. You might need the overpriced USBi too if you do not have one. The DSP runs some preprogrammed stuff which is kind'a useless but you can hook it up to SigmaStudio right? We will see how easy this is. <br> [ADAU1452+AD1938](ADAU1452_AD1938_Thing/README.md) | ![bild](./images/Screenshot%202024-07-08%20at%2015-03-19%20ADAU1452-DSP%20Electronic%20Frequency%20Division%20AD1938-CODEC%20_CS42448%20Decoding%20Board%206%20IN%208%20OUT%20192K%20-%20AliExpress%2044.png){height=100}
